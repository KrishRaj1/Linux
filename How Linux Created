//Background 
  1980s, Unix OS used widely but it was proprietry and expensive.

//Free Version
MINIX(Developed by AndrewS. Tanenbaum in 1987) was available, but it was limited.



//Linux
Linus Torvalds Starts Linux (1991)
 -> He began writing his own operating system kernel (the core part of an OS that manages hardware and software interactions
    GNU Project (started in 1983 by Richard Stallman) was developing free software tools—compilers, libraries, shells, etc.—but lacked a working kernel.
    Together, GNU software + Linux kernel = GNU/Linux operating system.

 -> Today, Linux powers:
    Most web servers and cloud infrastructure.
    Nearly all supercomputers.
    Android phones (built on the Linux kernel).
    Many embedded systems (routers, IoT, smart devices).
    Popular desktop distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, Arch, etc).
